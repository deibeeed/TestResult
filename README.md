# Hi
this project will let us see how we can activate and use kotlin's result
but I suggest that we use our own sort of Result class since
it is indicated in the documentation the kotlin's result class will
change at any time.

To protect ourselves, we will just use a Result class that's the same as
the kotlin's.

I have a different approach, which i use Status to propagate result.
